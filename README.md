Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp: Python and Visualization Assignment

The PyMaceuticals assignment analyzed the effectiveness of multiple, potential cancer treatments on 250 lab mice. The 45-day trial administered and studied nine drugs and one placebo on mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The presented analysis takes a closer look at three drugs: Capomulin, Infubinol and Ketapril.

And the winner is... Capomulin
The provided data is conclusive: at this stage of the research, Capomulin is the most promising of the new drugs. Unlike the other drugs (and placebo), tumors responded positively to treatment with Capomulin and decreased in size by nearly 20%.  Additionally, the cancerâ€™s metastatic speed was slowest when using Capomulin. Finally, the mice administered Capomulin experienced the highest survival rates.

Although the data is hopefu, it should be noted that many scientific studies have questioned animal research as a worthy predictor of human reaction. Animal studies have been criticized for being poorly design - and even when properly conducted, animals and humans share only varying degrees of similarities. It is advised to remain cautiously optimistic and pursue further trials on Capomulin before forming any further conclusions.
